# Trading Indicators Repository

Welcome to the **Trading Indicators** repository! This repository contains a comprehensive collection of technical indicators, including both common and exotic indicators, used across various markets such as stocks, cryptocurrencies, and forex. The indicators are implemented in Python and can be easily integrated into your trading systems for both backtesting and live trading purposes.

## Features

- A wide range of technical indicators, including:
  - Moving Averages (SMA, EMA)
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  - Bollinger Bands
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
  - ATR (Average True Range)
  - And more to come!
  
- Each indicator comes with well-documented code, including explanations of how to implement it in your trading strategies.
- Modular design allows for easy integration into existing trading systems.
- Ideal for both beginner and advanced traders looking to customize or enhance their trading algorithms.

## Current Indicators

### Simple Indicators:
- **SMA (Simple Moving Average)**: A basic moving average calculated by averaging the closing prices over a specific period.
- **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: Similar to the SMA but gives more weight to recent prices.
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: A momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.
- **Bollinger Bands**: A volatility indicator that creates upper and lower bands around a simple moving average using standard deviations.
- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**: A trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages.
- **ATR (Average True Range)**: A measure of volatility that takes into account the range between daily highs and lows.

More indicators will be added in the future!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib` (for plotting)

You can install all dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt



## Installation

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/trading-indicators.git
cd trading-indicators
```

### Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each indicator is implemented as a separate Python module, and you can import them into your trading scripts as needed.

### Example usage for a simple moving average:

```python
from indicators.sma import calculate_sma

# Data is expected to be in a Pandas DataFrame with a 'Close' column
sma = calculate_sma(data['Close'], period=20)
print(sma)
```

### To calculate multiple indicators:

```python
from indicators.sma import calculate_sma
from indicators.rsi import calculate_rsi
from indicators.macd import calculate_macd

sma = calculate_sma(data, period=20)
rsi = calculate_rsi(data, period=14)
macd = calculate_macd(data)
```
